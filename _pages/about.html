<h1>Imperial Robotics Team 3734</h1>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/GroupPicture.JPG" alt="Team">

<p>We are FTC team 3734, A.K.A. Imperial Robotics located at the School of Science and Engineering in Dallas, TX. Our mission is to spread robotics in the world so that people learn how fun and engaging the robotics competitions of FIRST are. This year,
we hope to participate in several community service projects and build a robot using the help of the community. We
want to bring everyone together to create something that is truly revolutionary.</p>

<p>
  Hey I'm Austin, captain of FTC team 3734 Imperial Robotics, and currently a junior at the Science and Engineering magnet at Townview
  Magnet Center. I've been participating in both FTC and FRC robotics since the 7th grade and have taken all of my past experiences from
  various roles on teams to shape the way I lead 3734, with focus on individual involvement and learning. I joined robotics in order 
  to expand my knowledge of materials, mechanical engineering, and their applications in modern life, all of which started from my love
  of chemistry and physics.

<p>
  Hello! My name is Maximo Mateo.I'm currently a sophomore at the School Of Science and Engineering at Townview Magnet Center.This is my
  first year in robotics. I joined robotics so I could apply my knowledge in Physics and Computer Science to robotics. I also joined robotics
  so I could experience teamwork, programming, and building. Learning these things in robotics can be useful in the future because we're dealing
  with real-life situations.Such as Robots!!!
